# Microsoft Azure Data Box management client library for .NET

Microsoft Azure Data Box devices easily move data to Azure when busy networks aren’t an option. Move large amounts of data to Azure when you're limited by time, network availability, or costs, using common copy tools such as Robocopy. All data is AES-encrypted, and the devices are wiped clean after upload, in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-88 revision 1 standards.

This library supports managing Microsoft Azure Customer Insights resources.

This library follows the [new Azure SDK guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html), and provides many core capabilities:

    - Support MSAL.NET, Azure.Identity is out of box for supporting MSAL.NET.
    - Support [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for distributed tracing.
    - HTTP pipeline with custom policies.
    - Better error-handling.
    - Support uniform telemetry across all languages.
